              James Gordon Bennett Sr. (September 1, 1795 - June 1, 1872) was
              the founder, editor and publisher of the New York Herald and a
              major figure in the history of American newspapers.
            </p>
            <p class="me-5">
              Bennett was born to a prosperous Roman Catholic family in Newmill,
              Banffshire, Scotland, Great Britain. At age 15, Bennett entered
              the Roman Catholic seminary in Aberdeen, where he remained for
              four years. After leaving the seminary, he read voraciously on his
              own and traveled throughout Scotland.
            </p>
            <p class="me-5">
              In 1819, he joined a friend who was sailing to North America.
              After four weeks they landed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where
              Bennett briefly worked as a schoolmaster till he had enough money
              to sail south to Portland, Maine, where he again taught school in
              the village of Addison, moving on to Boston, Massachusetts by New
              Year's Day, 1820. He worked in New England as a proofreader and
              bookseller before the Charleston Courier in Charleston, South
              Carolina hired him to translate Spanish language news reports, so
              he briefly relocated to the South. He moved back north to New York
              City in 1823, where he worked first as a freelance paper writer
              and, then, assistant editor of the New York Courier and Enquirer,
              one of the oldest newspapers in the city.

              Bennett Park, also known as James Gordon Bennett Park, is a
              1.8-acre (0.73 ha) public park in New York City, named for James
              Gordon Bennett, Sr., the newspaper publisher who launched the New
              York Herald in 1835. It is located between Pinehurst and Fort
              Washington Avenues and West 183rd and 185th Streets in the Hudson
              Heights neighborhood of Washington Heights in northern Manhattan,
              on land purchased by Bennett in 1871, the year before his death.
              It sits opposite the northern Fort Washington Avenue entrance to
              the 181st Street subway station on the IND Eighth Avenue Line,
              serviced by the A train.
            </p>
            <p class="ms-5">
              The park, which opened in 1929, was built on the site of Fort
              Washington, from which the Continental Army delayed the advance of
              British troops in 1776. The commemorative marble, bronze and
              granite stele, with sculpture by Charles R. Lamb, is located on
              the eastern perimeter wall of the park, and was dedicated in 1901.
            </p>
            <p class="ms-5">
              On the west side of the park lies an outcropping of Manhattan
              schist which is the highest natural point in Manhattan - 265 feet
              (81 m) above sea level - with a square stone marker attesting to
              the fact.[5] The schist is part of the bedrock foundation of New
              York City, which allows the construction of skyscrapers where it
              lies close to the surface.
